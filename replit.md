# SPK Network 2.0 - Decentralized Storage Validation System

## Overview

SPK Network 2.0 (HivePoA) is a comprehensive decentralized storage validation protocol that integrates with the Hive blockchain for HBD (Hive Backed Dollar) payments. This is a complete reimplementation of the original SPK Network, repurposing code from trole, oratr, and proofofaccess repositories while removing unnecessary complexity.

**Core Innovation**: Proof of Access (PoA) - Cryptographic validation that storage nodes physically hold the files they claim to store.

## Recent Changes (December 2025)

### Hybrid PWA Architecture
- **Browser Node (Helia)**: In-browser IPFS node using Helia - no installation required
  - Auto-initializes on first use with IndexedDB persistence
  - Repurposed patterns from SPK Network oartr/trole repositories
  - Key Files: `client/src/lib/helia-client.ts`
- **Desktop Agent (Tauri)**: One-click 24/7 IPFS node for earning HBD rewards
  - Bundles Kubo binary - no separate IPFS installation needed
  - System tray integration - runs in background
  - HTTP API on port 5111 for web app detection
  - Auto-initializes IPFS repository on first run

- **LRU Block Cache**: TTL-based caching (1hr, max 1000 entries) for block CIDs
- **Batch Challenges**: 3 challenges per round instead of 1
- **Weighted Selection**: Low-rep nodes challenged more frequently

- **Consecutive Fail Tracking**: 3 failures = instant ban (stored in DB)
- **Streak Bonuses**: 10/50/100 consecutive passes earn 10%/25%/50% bonus
- **Recovery Cooldown**: Banned nodes wait 24h before reputation recovery
- **Config Constants**: All tunable parameters in `POA_CONFIG` object

### Key Design Decisions

**Health Score Encoding** (from SPK's trole/healthScore.js):
- Base64 characters represent z-scores (standard deviations)
- 2-character format: raw latency + geo-corrected
- `W` = 0 standard deviations (normal)
- Enables compact storage and network transmission

**Geographic Correction** (from SPK's trole/geoCorrection.js):
- Adjusts latency expectations based on distance
- Categories: same (5ms), local (20ms), continental (50ms), intercontinental (150ms)
- Prevents penalizing distant but healthy nodes

**Federated Trust Model**: Uses Hive's DPoS - Top 150 Witnesses as validators
**HBD as Payment Rail**: No custom tokens, just Hive Backed Dollars
**Reputation-Based Filtering**: Quality tiers via reputation thresholds

## Environment Variables

- **oratr**: Transcoding job management
- **proofofaccess**: PoA cryptographic algorithm (FNV-1a + SHA256)
